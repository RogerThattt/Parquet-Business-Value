# Parquet-Business-Value

📊 Scenario:
You're a Telecom B2C/B2B Analyst running RCA on order fallouts in Databricks. Orders fail due to reasons like missing customer data, product mismatch, or API timeouts.
Data size is huge (~terabytes daily), so Parquet is the chosen format for cost-effective and fast analysis.

💻 Databricks PySpark Example: Read Parquet & Analyze Root Cause
python
Copy
Edit
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, count

# Start Spark session (Databricks does this by default)
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("OrderFalloutRCA").getOrCreate()

# Read the fallout data stored as Parquet
fallout_df = spark.read.parquet("/mnt/bronze/order_fallouts.parquet")

# Sample Data Columns:
# order_id | customer_id | product_id | fallout_reason        | timestamp
# -------- | ----------  | ---------  | --------------------- | ---------
# 1234     | 567         | 890        | Missing Customer Data | 2024-03-01 10:00:00

# Analyze the top fallout reasons (RCA)
rca_df = fallout_df.groupBy("fallout_reason").agg(count("*").alias("fallout_count")).orderBy(col("fallout_count").desc())

# Show top 5 fallout reasons
rca_df.show(5)

📈 Business Value Delivered by Using Parquet in Databricks:
🏆 Benefit	💼 Business Value Impact
Query Performance Boost	RCA runs 10x faster due to column pruning (only fallout_reason is scanned). Analysts get insights in minutes.
Cost Efficiency	Reduced Databricks DBU compute costs and cloud storage cost due to Parquet compression.
Scalability	Handles terabytes of daily fallout data without slowing down. Supports future growth.
Real-Time RCA Loop	Supports building real-time dashboards in Power BI/Tableau connected to Parquet datasets on Delta Lake.
Actionable Insights	Quickly identifies top fallout reasons → Enables Product, Tech, and Ops teams to fix issues → Improves NPS.
🛠 Extend Example - Filter API Timeouts Only
python
Copy
Edit
api_timeouts_df = fallout_df.filter(col("fallout_reason") == "API Timeout")
api_timeouts_df.show()
🎯 Key Business Outcome:
"By using Parquet in Databricks, the company reduced RCA time from 2 hours to 10 minutes per day, decreased compute cost by 40%, and fixed the top 3 fallout reasons, improving order success rate by 15%." 🚀
